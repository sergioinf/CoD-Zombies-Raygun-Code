# Call of Duty: Zombies Ray Gun - Arduino Project


This project recreates the functionality of the Ray Gun from the Call of Duty: Zombies series using Arduino boards instead of the Adafruit boards from the original [The Ray Gun Project](https://theraygunprojectco.wixsite.com/trgp/craft). It is a functional replica with light and sound effects inspired by the game.

## Features
- Implementation using Arduino board.
- LED light effects simulating gunfire.
- Shooting and reloading sounds via an audio module.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, Nano, etc.).
- DFPlayer Mini sound module + speaker.
- LED strips or high-power RGB LEDs.
- Fire button and reload button.
- Battery or suitable power supply.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sergioinf/CoD-Zombies-Raygun-Code.git
   ```
2. Open the code in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the required libraries from the Library Manager:
   - `DFRobotDFPlayerMini`
   - `Adafruit_NeoPixel`
4. Connect the components following the wiring diagram.
5. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
6. Enjoy your Ray Gun!
